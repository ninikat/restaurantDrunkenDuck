Create a page which displays all the dishes on a web page. The listing will include the following: 

Title

Description

Price 

ImageURL (Display the image not the actual image URL) :) 

 

The page should also have an option to FILTER the dishes by course: 

Starters

Entrees

Desserts 

 

The "dishes.js" file is attached which contains all the dishes you will be using for your website. 

 

* Make sure the website is responsive on mobile devices.
